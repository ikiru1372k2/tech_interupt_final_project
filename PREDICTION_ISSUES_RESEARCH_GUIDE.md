# Prediction Issues Research Guide

## 🎯 Focus Areas for Research

Based on your concern about predictions crossing 30 hours, here are specific areas to research:

## 1. 🔍 Data Analysis

### Check Training Data Quality
```python
# Run this analysis on your training data
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Analyze effort expense distribution
print("Effort Expense Analysis:")
print(f"Count: {df['effortExpense'].count()}")
print(f"Mean: {df['effortExpense'].mean():.2f}")
print(f"Median: {df['effortExpense'].median():.2f}")
print(f"Std: {df['effortExpense'].std():.2f}")
print(f"Min: {df['effortExpense'].min():.2f}")
print(f"Max: {df['effortExpense'].max():.2f}")

# Check for extreme values
print(f"\nValues > 30: {len(df[df['effortExpense'] > 30])}")
print(f"Values > 40: {len(df[df['effortExpense'] > 40])}")
print(f"Values > 50: {len(df[df['effortExpense'] > 50])}")

# Check missing values
print(f"\nMissing values: {df['effortExpense'].isna().sum()}")
```

### Research Questions:
- **Q1**: What's the actual distribution of effort expenses in your data?
- **Q2**: Are there extreme outliers (>50 hours) that skew the model?
- **Q3**: Is there enough data with reasonable values (10-30 hours)?

## 2. 🤖 Model Performance Analysis

### Check Model Metrics
```python
# After training, check these metrics
print("Model Performance:")
print(f"Train R²: {metrics['train_r2']:.4f}")
print(f"Test R²: {metrics['test_r2']:.4f}")
print(f"Train RMSE: {metrics['train_rmse']:.2f}")
print(f"Test RMSE: {metrics['test_rmse']:.2f}")

# Check for overfitting
if metrics['train_r2'] - metrics['test_r2'] > 0.1:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: Model is overfitting!")
    print("   Train R² is much higher than Test R²")
    print("   This means model memorized training data")
```

### Research Questions:
- **Q4**: Is the model overfitting? (Train R² >> Test R²)
- **Q5**: What's the RMSE? Is it reasonable for effort prediction?
- **Q6**: Does the model generalize well to new data?

## 3. 🎯 Prediction Analysis

### Analyze Prediction Patterns
```python
# After making predictions, analyze them
df_predicted = processor.predict_effort_expenses(df_processed)

# Get only predicted rows
predicted_rows = df_predicted[df_predicted['needs_prediction']]

print("Prediction Analysis:")
print(f"Total predictions made: {len(predicted_rows)}")
print(f"Missing value predictions: {predicted_rows['is_missing_effort'].sum()}")
print(f"Over-limit predictions: {predicted_rows['is_over_limit'].sum()}")

# Analyze prediction values
predictions = predicted_rows['effortExpense_predicted']
print(f"\nPrediction Statistics:")
print(f"Min prediction: {predictions.min():.2f}")
print(f"Max prediction: {predictions.max():.2f}")
print(f"Mean prediction: {predictions.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Median prediction: {predictions.median():.2f}")

# Check problematic predictions
high_predictions = predicted_rows[predicted_rows['effortExpense_predicted'] > 35]
print(f"\nPredictions > 35 hours: {len(high_predictions)}")
if len(high_predictions) > 0:
    print("Problematic predictions:")
    for idx, row in high_predictions.iterrows():
        print(f"  Row {idx}: {row['effortExpense_predicted']:.2f} hours")
```

### Research Questions:
- **Q7**: What's the range of predictions? (Min, Max, Mean)
- **Q8**: Are predictions clustered around realistic values?
- **Q9**: Which specific rows are getting high predictions?

## 4. 🔧 Feature Importance Analysis

### Check Which Features Drive Predictions
```python
# Get feature importance
feature_importance = processor.ml_model.get_model_info()['feature_importance']

# Sort by importance
sorted_features = sorted(feature_importance.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

print("Top 10 Most Important Features:")
for feature, importance in sorted_features[:10]:
    print(f"  {feature}: {importance:.4f}")

# Check if important features make sense
print("\nFeature Analysis:")
print("- Are time-based features important?")
print("- Are job titles driving predictions?")
print("- Are billing rates influencing effort?")
```

### Research Questions:
- **Q10**: Which features are most important for predictions?
- **Q11**: Do the important features make business sense?
- **Q12**: Are there unexpected features driving high predictions?

## 5. 📊 Data Distribution Research

### Check Feature Distributions
```python
# Analyze feature distributions
print("Feature Distribution Analysis:")

# Check categorical features
categorical_features = ['msg_JobTitle', 'msg_Community', 'taskType']
for feature in categorical_features:
    if feature in df.columns:
        print(f"\n{feature} distribution:")
        print(df[feature].value_counts())

# Check numerical features
numerical_features = ['effortTimeCosts', 'billingRate_hourlyRate']
for feature in numerical_features:
    if feature in df.columns:
        print(f"\n{feature} statistics:")
        print(f"  Mean: {df[feature].mean():.2f}")
        print(f"  Median: {df[feature].median():.2f}")
        print(f"  Std: {df[feature].std():.2f}")
        print(f"  Range: {df[feature].min():.2f} - {df[feature].max():.2f}")
```

### Research Questions:
- **Q13**: Are there imbalanced categories in your data?
- **Q14**: Do numerical features have extreme values?
- **Q15**: Is there correlation between features and effort?

## 6. 🎯 Specific Issues to Research

### Issue 1: Model Learning Wrong Patterns
```python
# Check if model learned from outliers
high_effort_data = df[df['effortExpense'] > 40]
print(f"Training data with >40 hours: {len(high_effort_data)}")

if len(high_effort_data) > 0:
    print("This data might be teaching the model wrong patterns!")
    print("Consider removing or capping these values.")
```

### Issue 2: Insufficient Training Data
```python
# Check training data size
training_data = df.dropna(subset=['effortExpense'])
print(f"Training data size: {len(training_data)} rows")

if len(training_data) < 50:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: Very small training dataset!")
    print("   Models need more data to learn patterns accurately.")
    print("   Consider collecting more data.")
```

### Issue 3: Feature Engineering Problems
```python
# Check if features are properly encoded
print("Feature Engineering Check:")
print("- Are all features numeric?")
print("- Are categorical features properly encoded?")
print("- Are there missing values in features?")
print("- Are features scaled properly?")
```

## 7. 🔬 Research Experiments

### Experiment 1: Remove Outliers
```python
# Try training without extreme values
df_no_outliers = df[df['effortExpense'] <= 40]  # Remove >40 hours
processor_clean = DataProcessor(model_type='lightgbm')
metrics_clean = processor_clean.train_model(df_no_outliers)

print("Results without outliers:")
print(f"Test R²: {metrics_clean['test_r2']:.4f}")
print(f"Test RMSE: {metrics_clean['test_rmse']:.2f}")
```

### Experiment 2: Different Model Parameters
```python
# Try more conservative parameters
conservative_params = {
    'num_leaves': 10,        # Even smaller trees
    'learning_rate': 0.01,   # Even lower learning rate
    'min_data_in_leaf': 20, # More data per leaf
    'reg_alpha': 1.0,        # More regularization
    'reg_lambda': 1.0        # More regularization
}

# Train with conservative parameters
processor_conservative = DataProcessor(model_type='lightgbm')
processor_conservative.ml_model.lightgbm_params.update(conservative_params)
metrics_conservative = processor_conservative.train_model(df)
```

### Experiment 3: Feature Selection
```python
# Try with fewer features
simple_features = ['effortTimeCosts', 'billingRate_hourlyRate', 'month', 'dayofweek']
# Train model with only these features
```
